        <p>We are a community organization for Haiti and persuaded to believe it’s our time to take the destiny of our country in our hands instead of leaving it in the hands of a band of  thugs.  

<p>Certainly we should be in communication as often as we want depending of your availability.  Now the state of affairs that put us on the path of each other to combine our forces to resolve is the Haitian crises which are lack of capable mind to bring an element of response to it without interest. To proceed with this quest we should have a dialogue to combine our expertise to bring that alternative to the situation in contention.</p> 
        
<p>Basically what we’re looking for is to have partners willing to work together voluntary in a TASK FORCE FOR HAITI with us and OPHAC HAITI, INC. This initiative will include all Haitians organization in the United States, Canada, Haiti and elsewhere. The goals are to demystify the Haitian situation and to enlighten why and how these things are happening in the country. </p>
